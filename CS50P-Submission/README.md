     -R                  : It will replace an existent file when creating a new database without confirmation.
     -db:filename.pkl    : Define the filename to be used.
     -l                  : List all password tags.
     -k:key              : add the "key" to decode the passwords.
     -t:tag              : select a specific tag.
     -v                  : view the password of a specific tag.

##### Example:
          python project.py -h
          python project.py -n -R -db:mypassword.pkl
          python project.py -db:mypassword.pkl -l
          python project.py -db:mypassword.pkl -a -r:Gmail -p:mypassword


##### Security Best Practices:
- Choose a Strong Master Password: This is your first line of defense. Make it long, complex, and unique to your password vault.
- Enable Automatic Backups: Regularly backing up your database ensures you can recover your data in case of unexpected events.

Be Cautious with Sharing: Never share your master password or application with anyone.
